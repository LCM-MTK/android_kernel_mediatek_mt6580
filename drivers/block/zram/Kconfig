	default n
	help
	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

config EXTREME_LOW_RAM
	bool "Support the device with memory smaller than 512M"
	default n
	help
	  This config decide if device memory < 512M
	  For 512M device, it has many low mem shrinking mechanism
	  Normal project will disable it first
	  If you are not sure about this, do not set it to y

config ZRAM_LZ4_COMPRESS
	bool "Enable LZ4 algorithm support"
	depends on ZRAM
	select LZ4_COMPRESS
	select CRYPTO_LZ4
	select CRYPTO_LZ4HC if EXTREME_LOW_RAM
	select LZ4_DECOMPRESS
	default n
	help
	  This option enables LZ4 compression algorithm support. Compression
	  algorithm can be changed using 'comp_algorithm' device attribute.
